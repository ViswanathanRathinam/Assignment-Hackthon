# Assignment 1 (Pick One):

## Developing a Web Application with Pre-Trained Deep Learning Model for Computer Vision

### Overview:
In this assignment, you will be developing a web application that integrates a pre-trained deep learning model for image recognition.

### Requirements:

Users should be able to do the following in the Web App:

    * Upload an image.

    * Pre-process the image for the deep learning model.
### Good to Have

Dockerize the solution and deploy using docker-compose

    * Predict the class of the uploaded image using the pre-trained model.

    * View the predicted class label and probability.

Justify the selection of the pre-trained model to the Hackthon panel. Briefly describe the dataset it was trained on, the architecture of the model, and the type of problem it was designed to solve.


### Good to Have

Dockerize the solution and deploy using docker-compose

### Submission:

 * Submit the source code for the web application.
 * Submit a brief report explaining your model selection justification.

## Developing a Web Application with Pre-Trained Deep Learning Model for Natural Language Processing

### Overview:
In this assignment, you will be developing a web application that integrates a pre-trained deep learning model for natural language processing (NLP).

### Requirements:

Users should be able to do the following in the Web App:

    * Able to enter a text input.

    * Pre-process the text for the deep learning model.

    * Predict the class of the text using the pre-trained model.

    * View the predicted class label and probability.

Justify the selection of the pre-trained model to the Hackthon panel. Briefly describe the dataset it was trained on, the architecture of the model, and the type of problem it was designed to solve.

### Good to Have

Dockerize the solution and deploy using docker-compose

### Submission:

 * Submit the source code for the web application.
 * Submit a brief report explaining your model selection justification.
